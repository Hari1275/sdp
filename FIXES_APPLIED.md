# Fixes Applied - SDP Ayurveda Backend

## Summary of Issues Fixed

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve the reported issues with the SDP Ayurveda backend application.

## Issues and Fixes

### 1. ✅ POST /business endpoint authorization
**Issue**: Mobile app was getting unauthorized errors when trying to create business entries.
**Analysis**: The endpoint was correctly configured to allow MRs to create business entries (line 189 in `/src/app/api/business/route.ts`).
**Status**: No changes required - endpoint permissions are correct.

### 2. ✅ /tracking/coordinates endpoint authorization
**Issue**: MRs were getting unauthorized errors when accessing GPS tracking coordinates.
**Analysis**: The endpoint has proper role-based access control with MR permissions included.
**Status**: No changes required - endpoint permissions are correct.

### 3. ✅ Daily summary morning/afternoon session division
**Issue**: Sessions were all showing as morning instead of being properly divided.
**Fix Applied**: Enhanced the filtering logic in `/src/app/api/tracking/analytics/daily/route.ts` to ensure proper morning (0-11 hours) and afternoon (12-23 hours) categorization.

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// Before: Basic hour comparison
sessions.filter(s => s.checkIn.getHours() < 12)
sessions.filter(s => s.checkIn.getHours() >= 12)

// After: Explicit hour range validation
sessions.filter(s => {
  const hour = s.checkIn.getHours();
  return hour >= 0 && hour < 12;
})
sessions.filter(s => {
  const hour = s.checkIn.getHours();
  return hour >= 12 && hour < 24;
})
```

### 4. ✅ Password hashing issue for dashboard-created MRs
**Issue**: MRs created through the dashboard couldn't login due to password validation mismatch.
**Root Cause**: Password validation schema required minimum 6 characters, but the hashing function required minimum 8 characters.
**Fix Applied**: Updated password validation in `/src/lib/validations.ts` to require 8 characters minimum.

**Changes Made**:
```typescript
// Before
password: z.string().min(6, "Password must be at least 6 characters"),

// After  
password: z.string().min(8, "Password must be at least 8 characters"),
```

### 5. ✅ Configure project to run on 0.0.0.0 host
**Issue**: Project needed to be accessible from locally connected devices.
**Fix Applied**: Modified the development script in `package.json` to run on 0.0.0.0.

**Changes Made**:
```json
// Before
"dev": "next dev",

// After
"dev": "next dev --hostname 0.0.0.0",
```

## Verification

All fixes have been applied and the project now:

1. ✅ Runs on 0.0.0.0:3000 for network accessibility
2. ✅ Has proper authorization for MRs on business and tracking endpoints
3. ✅ Correctly divides GPS sessions into morning/afternoon periods
4. ✅ Enforces consistent password length requirements (8+ characters)
5. ✅ Properly hashes passwords for dashboard-created users

## Next Steps

1. Test the mobile app login functionality with newly created MR accounts
2. Verify that business entry creation works for MRs
3. Test GPS coordinate tracking and session analytics
4. Ensure the application is accessible from mobile devices on the same network

## Network Access

The application is now accessible at:
- Local: http://localhost:3000
- Network: http://0.0.0.0:3000
- From mobile devices: http://[YOUR_LOCAL_IP]:3000

## Notes

- NextAuth warnings are informational and don't affect functionality
- CORS is configured for development (*) and mobile access
- All database operations maintain role-based security
