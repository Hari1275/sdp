# Story 1.4: Core API Endpoints Development

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer building the SDP Ayurveda system,
**I want** core API endpoints for user management, client operations, and basic data access,
**so that** the mobile app and dashboard can interact with the backend data securely and efficiently

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User management API endpoints are implemented (CRUD operations)
2. Client management API endpoints are created with duplicate prevention
3. Business entry API endpoints are implemented
4. Task management API endpoints are created
5. Geographic data API endpoints (regions/areas) are implemented
6. All endpoints include proper authentication and authorization
7. Role-based access control is enforced on all endpoints
8. Input validation is implemented for all endpoints
9. Error handling and logging are consistent across all endpoints
10. API responses follow consistent JSON format
11. Rate limiting is implemented for API protection
12. API documentation is generated and accessible

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story builds on Stories 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3. The developer should have:
- Next.js project with TypeScript configured
- Prisma with MongoDB schema implemented
- User authentication system with NextAuth.js
- Basic project structure and middleware in place

### Data Models
**All models from Story 1.2 are available:**
- User model with role-based access
- Client and BusinessEntry models
- Task management models
- Geographic data models (Region, Area)
- GPS tracking models

- Input validation tests
- Error handling tests
- Rate limiting tests
- Performance tests for large datasets

### Technical Constraints
- Next.js API routes with TypeScript
- Prisma for database operations
- NextAuth.js for authentication
- Zod for input validation
- Rate limiting for API protection
- Consistent error handling
- Role-based access control

[Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#technology-stack]

### Environment Variables Required
- `DATABASE_URL`: MongoDB connection (from Story 1.2)
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: JWT signing secret (from Story 1.3)
- `API_RATE_LIMIT`: Rate limiting configuration
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (development/production)

### Security Considerations
- All endpoints require authentication
- Role-based access control on all operations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- CORS configuration for mobile app access

## Testing
- Test all CRUD operations for each endpoint
- Test authentication and authorization
- Test input validation and error handling
- Test rate limiting functionality
- Test role-based filtering and access
- Test API response format consistency
- Performance test with large datasets
