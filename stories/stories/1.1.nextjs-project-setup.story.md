# Story 1.1: Next.js Project Setup with TypeScript and Prisma

## Status
Confirmed

## Story
**As a** development team member,
**I want** a properly configured Next.js project with TypeScript and Prisma setup,
**so that** we have a solid foundation for building the SDP Ayurveda backend API and dashboard

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Next.js latest version project is initialized with App Router architecture
2. TypeScript is configured with strict type checking
3. Prisma is set up with MongoDB connector
4. Basic project structure follows the architecture guidelines
5. Development environment is ready for local development
6. Basic folder structure matches the unified project structure
7. Essential dependencies are installed and configured
8. Environment configuration is set up for development

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Initialize Next.js  project with TypeScript (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create new Next.js project with App Router
  - [x] Configure TypeScript with strict settings
  - [x] Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- [x] Set up Prisma with MongoDB (AC: 3)
  - [x] Install Prisma dependencies
  - [x] Initialize Prisma with MongoDB connector
  - [x] Configure database connection
  - [x] Set up environment variables for database
- [x] Create project folder structure (AC: 4, 6)
  - [x] Set up src/app directory structure for API routes
  - [x] Create lib directory for utilities and configurations
  - [x] Set up components directory structure
  - [x] Create types directory for TypeScript definitions
- [x] Configure development environment (AC: 5, 7, 8)
  - [x] Set up .env.local for environment variables
  - [x] Configure package.json scripts for development
  - [x] Set up Git repository with proper .gitignore
  - [x] Install and configure essential dependencies

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the foundation story.

### Data Models
Based on the backend architecture, the following models will be needed:
- User model with role-based access (MR, LEAD_MR, ADMIN)
- Region and Area models for geographic data
- Client model for client information
- BusinessEntry model for transaction recording
- Task model for task management
- GPSSession and GPSLog models for tracking

[Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#database-schema-design]

### API Specifications
The project will need API routes organized as follows:
- /api/auth/* - Authentication endpoints
- /api/users/* - User management
- /api/clients/* - Client data operations
- /api/business/* - Business entry operations
- /api/tasks/* - Task management
- /api/tracking/* - GPS and location data
- /api/reports/* - Analytics and reporting

[Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#api-design]

### Component Specifications
For the dashboard components, the project will use:
- shadcn/ui for base components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Hook Form for form management
- Recharts for data visualization
- Leaflet for interactive maps

[Source: docs/architecture/dashboard-architecture.md#technology-stack]

### File Locations
Based on the unified project structure:
- API routes: src/app/api/
- Dashboard pages: src/app/dashboard/
- Components: src/components/
- Utilities: src/lib/
- Types: src/types/
- Prisma schema: prisma/schema.prisma

[Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#api-implementation-structure]

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for API endpoints
- Component testing for dashboard elements
- Integration tests for database operations
- E2E tests for critical user flows

### Technical Constraints
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript strict mode
- MongoDB Atlas for database
- Prisma as ORM
- Vercel for deployment
- Environment variables for configuration

[Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#technology-stack]

## Testing
- Set up Jest and React Testing Library
- Configure test environment for Next.js
- Create basic test structure for API routes
- Set up test database configuration
