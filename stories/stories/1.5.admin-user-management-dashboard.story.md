# Story 1.5: Admin User Management Dashboard

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As an** administrator of the SDP Ayurveda system,

2. User listing page shows all users with filtering and search capabilities
3. User creation form allows adding new MRs and Lead MRs with role assignment
4. User editing functionality enables updating user details and role changes
5. User deactivation/reactivation functionality is implemented
6. Region and area management interface is available
7. Role-based access control is enforced (Admin only access)
8. Responsive design works on desktop and tablet devices
9. Real-time data updates when users are modified
10. Export functionality for user data (CSV/Excel)
11. Audit logging for all user management actions
12. Dashboard navigation and layout follow design system guidelines

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

This story builds on Stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4. The developer should have:

- Next.js project with TypeScript configured
- Prisma with MongoDB schema implemented
- User authentication system with NextAuth.js
- Core API endpoints for user management
- Basic project structure and middleware in place

### Data Models

**User Model (from Story 1.2):**

```typescript
model User {
  id          String   @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  username    String   @unique
  password    String
  name        String
  role        UserRole
  region      String?
  leadMRId    String?  @db.ObjectId
  leadMR      User?    @relation("LeadMRToMR", fields: [leadMRId], references: [id])
  teamMembers User[]   @relation("LeadMRToMR")
  isActive    Boolean  @default(true)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
}

enum UserRole {
  MR
  LEAD_MR
  ADMIN
}
```

**Geographic Models:**

```typescript
model Region {
  id        String @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  name      String @unique
  areas     Area[]
  users     User[]
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}

model Area {
  id       String @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  name     String
  regionId String @db.ObjectId
  region   Region @relation(fields: [regionId], references: [id])
  clients  Client[]
  tasks    Task[]
}
```
