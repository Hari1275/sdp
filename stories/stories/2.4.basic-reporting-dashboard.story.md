# Story 2.4: Basic Reporting Dashboard

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Lead MR or Admin user,
**I want** a comprehensive reporting dashboard with key performance metrics and data visualization,
**so that** I can monitor team performance, track business activities, and make data-driven decisions

## Acceptance Criteria

2. User performance reports show individual MR metrics and rankings
3. Regional performance reports display area-wise statistics
4. Client activity reports track business interactions and outcomes
5. GPS tracking reports show field activity and travel metrics
6. Task completion reports display assignment and completion statistics
7. Export functionality for all reports in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV)
8. Date range filtering for all reports with custom periods
9. Role-based access control for different report types
10. Real-time data updates for live dashboard metrics
11. Report scheduling and automated delivery system
12. Interactive charts and visualizations for data insights

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story builds on Epic 1 (Stories 1.1-1.5) and Stories 2.1-2.3. The developer should have:
- Complete Next.js foundation with TypeScript and Prisma
- MongoDB schema with all required models
- User authentication system with role-based access
- Core API endpoints infrastructure
- Client management, GPS tracking, and task assignment systems

### Data Models
**Reporting Models (from Story 1.2):**
```typescript
model Report {
  id          String   @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  name        String
  type        ReportType
  parameters  Json?    // Report parameters and filters
  createdBy   String   @db.ObjectId
  user        User     @relation(fields: [createdBy], references: [id])
  isScheduled Boolean  @default(false)
  schedule    Json?    // Schedule configuration
  lastRun     DateTime?
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt

  @@index([createdBy])
  @@index([type])
  @@index([isScheduled])
}

enum ReportType {
  USER_PERFORMANCE
  REGIONAL_PERFORMANCE
  CLIENT_ACTIVITY
  GPS_TRACKING
  TASK_COMPLETION
  DASHBOARD_OVERVIEW
}

model ReportSchedule {
  id        String   @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  reportId  String   @db.ObjectId
  report    Report   @relation(fields: [reportId], references: [id])
  frequency ScheduleFrequency
  recipients String[] // Email addresses
  isActive  Boolean  @default(true)
  lastSent  DateTime?
  nextRun   DateTime?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())

  @@index([reportId])
  @@index([isActive])
  @@index([nextRun])
}

enum ScheduleFrequency {
  DAILY
  WEEKLY
  MONTHLY
  QUARTERLY
  YEARLY
}
```
